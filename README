ANALYSIS
...
Using a stack would retrieve the TraceState Objects from
with the longest path, until reaching those with the shortest path
A queue on the other hand, would start at the shortest path and 
end with the longest TraceStates being evaluated.

 The amount of possible paths isn't affected by
 the choice of storage since each stack trace will
 always be evaluated and the location of objects on
 the board will not change.
 
 The runtime for the brute search is O(n).
 The amount of memory use will stay the same since they are
 both linked list implementations.
 
 Both structures should average the same time to find a 
 solution. If the solution path is short, compared to
 the length of the board, the queue will be faster,
 otherwise the stack will be quicker.
 
 Using a queue guarantees the first solution will be 
 a shortest path since it evaluates shortest to longest
 paths.
